Welcome to HDF-EOS Tools and Information Center GitHub Pages!</h3>

<p>HDF is the prescribed format for standard data products that are derived from EOS missions. 
  HDF-EOS (Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System) is 
  a self-describing file format for transfer of various types of data 
  between different machines based upon HDF. 
  HDF-EOS is a standard format to store data collected from EOS satellites: Terra, Aqua and Aura. 
  Two versions of HDF-EOS libraries: HDF-EOS2 (v3.0) based on HDF4 and HDF-EOS5 (v2.0) based on HDF5 are developed.
</p>
<p>
This site is dedicated to information about HDF-EOS and about tools 
  available to view or work with HDF-EOS and other NASA HDF files. 
  Programming (C, Fortran, IDL®, MATLAB®, and Python) and tool examples 
  to access HDF-EOS and other NASA HDF files are also available. 
  It also hosts an archive of presentations made at an annual HDF/HDF-EOS workshop.
</p>
The EOS program's remote sensing technology and data products 
are unique NASA contributions to the scientific study of the Earth. 
EOS missions include those listed in the following charts (click on chart to see details):
